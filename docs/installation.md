# Installation

To install, use [`npm`][npm] or [`yarn`][yarn]:

```sh
npm install fabula -g
yarn global add fabula
```

## Highlighting

As new and experimental as **Fabula** is, there's no code editor or IDE plugin available providing specialized syntax highlighting. For the moment, just set
your editor's syntax settings to **XML** when editing **Fabula** files.

## Disclaimer

**Fabula** is currently in **beta phase**, that is to say, we're still testing
on several projects and making sure all potential issues are addressed. Don't 
use it in production just yet unless you're sure what you're doing. And please 
[file an issue on Github][gh-issue] if you find anything that needs attention.
