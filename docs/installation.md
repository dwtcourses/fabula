## Disclaimer

**Fabula** is currently in **beta phase**, that is to say, we're still testing
on several projects and making sure all potential issues are addressed. Don't 
use it in production just yet unless you're sure what you're doing. Adn please 
[file an issue on Github][gh-issue] if you find anything that needs attention.
